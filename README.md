# 🩺 TeleMedi – Intelligent Medical Chatbot

> **An AI-powered medical conversational assistant built using Trie-based dialogue mapping and Levenshtein distance for fuzzy matching.**  
> The system interacts with users through natural conversation and suggests possible remedies based on symptoms.

---

## 🌟 Overview

**TeleMedi** is a healthcare-focused chatbot that allows users to describe their symptoms in simple text.  
Using a **Conversational Trie** and **Levenshtein Distance algorithm**, it intelligently identifies the closest medical condition and provides **appropriate remedies or next-step advice**.

It’s designed as a **Spring Boot application** with a clean, modular backend architecture and can be integrated with a frontend UI or chat interface.

---

## ⚙️ Features

✅ Dynamic symptom detection using Trie-based search  
✅ Fuzzy input matching via Levenshtein distance (handles typos)  
✅ Interactive dialogue flow with multiple health branches  
✅ Provides remedies and medical advice for each detected condition  
✅ Extensible structure for adding new diseases/symptoms  
✅ Simple, modular codebase for educational or clinical use

## 🧠 Core Logic

The chatbot builds a **conversation tree (Trie)**, where:
- Each **node** represents a medical condition or user response.
- Children represent **next questions or outcomes**.
- Each node can hold:
  - A **prompt/question**
  - A list of **suggestions**
  - A **remedy or advice**
  - A flag indicating if it’s an **end node**

### 🔍 Input Handling
When a user enters a message:
1. The system searches for an **exact keyword match**.
2. If not found, it tries **partial/multi-word matches**.
3. If still not found, it uses the **Levenshtein distance algorithm** to find the *closest* word (tolerating typos and small mistakes).

### 🧩 Example
If user types:
"fevar" → Levenshtein distance = 1 → closest match = "fever"

Copy code
Bot replies accordingly with fever-related questions/remedies.

## 🧮 Algorithms Used

### 1. **Trie (Prefix Tree)**
Used to store medical dialogues and responses hierarchically.

### 2. **Levenshtein Distance**
Used to calculate minimum edit distance between user input and known symptom keywords.  
Handles spelling errors and fuzzy matches efficiently.

Formula:  
`distance = number of insertions + deletions + substitutions`

## 🧑‍💻 Example Interaction

**Bot:** Hello! I'm your medical assistant. How are you feeling today?  
**User:** I have a hedache.  
**Bot:** You mentioned a headache. Can you describe the type of pain?  
**User:** throbbing  
**Bot:** A throbbing headache noted. Do you experience sensitivity to light or sound?  
**User:** yes  
**Bot:** This sounds like a migraine headache.  
**💊 Remedy:** Take Sumatriptan 50mg or Ibuprofen 400mg. Rest in a dark, quiet room. Apply cold compress.

## 💾 Data Backup

All user interactions can be stored for:
- Chat history
- Medical case review
- Future AI model training

Can be integrated with:
- MySQL / MongoDB (for persistent storage)
- Local JSON/CSV (for demo)

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

🔹 Integrate with LLMs for more natural language understanding  
🔹 Add symptom severity detection via NLP  
🔹 Voice-based interaction  
🔹 Connect with real doctors through Telemedicine APIs  
🔹 Mobile app integration (React Native / Flutter)
